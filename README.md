# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch

Welcome to my repository of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch. In this collection, I have implemented a variety of classical machine learning algorithms from scratch to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts. Each notebook includes code, explanations, and results from different machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into three main categories based on the type of algorithms I implemented:

- **Clustering with K-Means, K-Modes, and K-Prototypes**\
This notebook covers clustering algorithms, starting with the k-means algorithm and extending to k-modes and k-prototypes. The focus is on understanding how clustering works with numerical and categorical data, and the differences in their behavior depending on the type of data being processed.

- **KNN and Logistic Regression**\
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification and Logistic Regression. The goal was to build these models from scratch to understand how the algorithms classify data. It also covers key concepts such as distance metrics used in KNN, as well as the sigmoid function, cost function, and gradient descent in Logistic Regression.

- **Decision Tree**\
This notebook explores decision trees, including both the process of building the tree and techniques for pruning to prevent overfitting. The implementation covers the algorithm's ability to recursively partition data based on features and the decision rules created at each node.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or open the individual Google Colab notebooks for execution:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matija13795/ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch
```

2. Each file contains a Jupyter Notebook with an implementation of a different machine learning algorithm. Open the notebooks in Google Colab or your preferred Jupyter environment.
3. Each notebook contains explanations and code. Follow the markdown cells for a detailed breakdown of the concepts and implementation.

## Requirements
To run the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
