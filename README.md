# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch

Welcome to my repository of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch. In this collection, I have implemented a variety of classical machine learning algorithms from scratch to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts. Each notebook includes code, explanations, and results from different machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into three main categories based on the type of algorithms I implemented:

- **Clustering with K-Means, K-Modes, and K-Prototypes**\\
This notebook covers clustering algorithms, starting with the k-means algorithm and extending to k-modes and k-prototypes. The focus is on understanding how clustering works with numerical and categorical data, and the differences in their behavior depending on the type of data being processed.

- **KNN and Logistic Regression**\\
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification and Logistic Regression. The goal was to build these models from scratch and understand how the algorithms classify data, as well as the underlying concepts such as distance metrics for KNN and sigmoid functions for Logistic Regression.

- **Decision Tree**\\
This notebook explores decision trees, including both the process of building the tree and techniques for pruning to prevent overfitting. The implementation covers the algorithm's ability to recursively partition data based on features and the decision rules created at each node.
