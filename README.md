# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch

Welcome to my repository of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch. In this collection, I have implemented a variety of classical machine learning algorithms from scratch to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts. Each notebook includes code, explanations, and results from different machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into three main categories based on the type of algorithms I implemented:

- Clustering Algorithms:
  - K-Means: Implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm to classify data points into distinct clusters.
  - K-Modes: Adaptation of k-means for categorical data using modes instead of means.
  - K-Prototypes: A combination of k-means and k-modes to handle mixed data types (numerical and categorical).

- Supervised Learning:
  - Logistic Regression: Built from scratch to predict binary outcomes, with exploration of regularization techniques.
  - Decision Tree: Implemented decision trees from scratch, including techniques for pruning to improve model performance.

- Neural Networks:
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A simple CNN implemented for image classification tasks.
  - Deep Neural Network (DNN) for Recommender System: Designed a DNN to predict user preferences and provide personalized recommendations.
